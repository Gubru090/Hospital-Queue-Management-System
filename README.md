# Hospital-Queue-Management-System
->This is Hospital Queue Management System built in C++ using Circular and Priority Queues.  
->It allows users to add and serve patients as either emergency or normal cases.  
->Emergency patients are prioritized (1 = High, 2 = Medium, 3 = Low), while normal patients follow a first-come, first-served order.  
->Each patient has a name, age, problem, and bill calculated based on their case type.  
->Emergency bills range from Rs. 1000 to Rs. 5000, and normal patients are charged Rs. 500.  
->The program features a menu-driven interface with input validation and queue display.  
->Itâ€™s a great project to learn about data structures and queue handling in C++
